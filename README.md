## 📖 Overview

**Aquarium Configuration (240L Freshwater Community Tank)**

This repository hosts a standalone HTML document representing a personal aquarium setup and configuration for a 240-liter freshwater community tank (specifically designed for a Fluval Roma 240).
Please note that the content and interface of this configuration guide are presented exclusively in Spanish.

**Note:** This project is not intended to be a general aquascaping guide. It is a specific layout, stocking plan, and parameter reference designed for my personal testing and visualization.
