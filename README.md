# Acuario-Config
Aquarium Configuration (240L Freshwater Community Tank) This repository contains an HTML file representing my personal aquarium setup and configuration for a 240-liter freshwater community tank. It is not intended to be a general guide, but rather a specific layout, stocking plan, and parameter reference that I am testing for my own use.
